# In your own words, explain css specificity.

CSS specificity refers to the way that a browser determines which CSS styles should be applied to an element on a webpage. When there are multiple conflicting styles applied to an element, the browser follows a set of rules to determine which style should take precedence.

Values assigned to different selectors

Type selectors: 0,0,0,1
Class selectors: 0,0,1,0
ID selectors: 0,1,0,0
Inline styles: 1,0,0,0

the final specifity is the addition of relevant selectors on an element

this simply implies:
inline style > ID selector > class > Type selectors

the keyword `!Important` can be used to overide specificity for a css property regardless of its selector
