# What is your prefered layout system: inline-block, floating + clearing, flex, grid, other?  And why?

My preference layout is flex and Grid

I personally find flex and Grid very intuitive and easy to think about.

Also I favour the combination of both rather than doggedly preferring one over the other

I reserve inline-block for when I want to use an html block element for inline content for presentation purpose

Floating and clearing? I never found them intuitive and Flex and Grid just makes styling more predictable and less error prone from my perspective

And I would argue Flex and Grid are the industry standard now, as more developers are adopting this and most CSS frameworks in the frontend ecosystem opts for these as well.
