## If a <div/> has no margin or other styling and a <p/> tag inside of it has a margin top of some kind, the margin from the <p/> tag will show up on the div instead (the margin will show above the div not inside of it), why is this?  What are the different things that can be done to prevent it?

This is concept known as margin collapse, it occurs when there is nothing (text node, element node, any html node) between margins of a parent element and its child, and also only happens to the top and bottom margins, not the left and right. ~~a shocking revelation to me at the time :)~~

Preventions:

- Use padding on the parent element instead of margin on the child element: The padding property affects the space inside of an element's content box, rather than the space around it. This creates space inside of the parent element rather than around it.

- put any htmlNode before the child element of the div.

- there is a fix with float, but I don't do floats.
- Flex/Grid layouts are fullproof against this pitfall.
