# Are negative margins legal and what do they do (margin: -20px)?

The are legal (unlike negative padding).

In simple words, they move the positioned element in the opposite direction as the positive counter part would, they can be employed to make adjacent elements overlap

Here is an example of how negative margins can be used in CSS:

```css
.overlap {
  margin-top: -20px;
}
```
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="overlap">I will overlap the top of the container by 20px</div>
</div>
```
