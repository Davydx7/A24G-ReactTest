# In your own words, explain, what is ‘!important’ in css.  Also how does it work?  Are there any special circumstances when using it, where it’s behaviour might not be what you expect?

!important is a CSS keyword that can be used to give a style higher priority/ specificity than any other styles that might be applied to an element. When a style is marked as !important, it will always take precedence over any other styles, regardless of specificity.

This is especially useful when working with third party styling solutions that are difficult to override.

example

```css
p {
  color: red !important;
}
```

In this example, all p elements on the page will be displayed in red, even if there are other styles applied to the p elements that specify a different color in a another stylesheet.

I got to only realize on practice that the keyword only works from a stylesheet and not when stated inline with the html
