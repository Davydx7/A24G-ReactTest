# Add the following code to your project root (same project as in step 2, but add the code in the global / window space):

    Let divHeight;
    window.setDivHeight = (height) => divHeight = height;

Add a HOC for your div component that allows you to set the height of your <div/> component from the previous steps by calling that external function.

If you do not know what a HOC is or how to create one, that is also fine, just mention that in your answer and instead create a parent component that can still do this (allow you to call that function ‘setDivHeight’ in order to set the height of the div manually.

Bare in mind that when the height of the div is forcefully set like this, the text fields value should also update to reflect this and should still carry on working as normal (user can continue to modify its value).

___

```javascript
// setDivHeight.js

let divHeight;
window.setDivHeight = (height) => divHeight = height;
```

And as well the HOC

```tsx
// src/HOC/withExternalHeightControl.jsX

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function withExternalHeightControl(WrappedComponent: REact.ComponentType<any>) {
  return function ExternalHeightControl(props): JSX.Element {
    const [height, setHeight] = useState<Number>(200);

    useEffect(() => {
			// force change height every 5 seconds
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
				setHeight(setDivHeight(500));
				// I should subscribe to change in the window variable
				// "divHeight" to automatically update state if setDivHeight was to be called/updated from somewhere else
				}, 5000);

  		return () => clearInterval(interval);
    }, []);

    return <WrappedComponent {...props} forcedHeight={height} />;
  };
}
```

and finally the wrapped component receives the height prop and its state is initialized with the that height.
that way the input field updates with the window.divHeight variable changes.


```tsx
// LiveWidth.tsx

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function LiveWidth({forcedHeight}): JSX.Element {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState<Number>(window.innerWidth);
  const [height, setHeight] = useState<Number>(forcedHeight || 200);
  // ...
  return (
    <div style={{ border: '1px solid black', height }}>
      <span>{width}</span>
      <input type="number" value={height} onKeyDown={handleHeightChange} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
