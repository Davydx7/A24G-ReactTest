# Explain an interesting way in which you have used this javascript feature.

During a project where i was working with regex,

I used optional chaining to check if a match exists then access the match

```javascript
let match = string.match(/regex/)?[0]
```

Next is a snippet from my code to tranform md to html
This saves extra steps in checking if `rows.shif()` is truthy(exists) before performing further operations.

```javascript
	const headingRow: string = rows
		.shift() // remove first row (heading)
		?.split('|')
		.slice(1, -1)
		.map((thCell, i) => `<th${alignment[i] || ''}>${thCell.trim()}</th>`)
		.join('')!;

	rows.shift(); // remove second row (alignment)
```
