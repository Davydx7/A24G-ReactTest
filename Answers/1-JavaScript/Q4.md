# What is the difference between ‘myFunctionCall(++foo)’   and  ‘myFunctionCall(foo++)’ ?

the difference between `myFunctionCall(++foo)` and `myFunctionCall(foo++)` is in the order in which the increment operator (++) and the function call are evaluated/called.

```javascript
let foo = 1

myFunctionCall(++foo)  // function called with foo = 2

myFunctionCall(foo++) // function called with foo = 1

// in both cases the variable foo now points to a value of 2
```

In the first case, `++foo` is evaluated first, which increments the value of foo by 1 and then passes the result to the `myFunctionCall` function. In the example, foo is initially set to 1, the expression `myFunctionCall(++foo)` would first increment `foo` to 2, and then pass the value 2 to the myFunctionCall function.

In the second case, `foo++` is evaluated first, which passes the current value of `foo` to the myFunctionCall function and then increments foo by 1. In the example, foo is initially set to 1, the expression `myFunctionCall(foo++)` would first pass the value 1 to the myFunctionCall function, and then increment foo to 2.

 `++` and `--` operators have higher precedence than most other operators in JavaScript, so they will be evaluated before the function call in both cases.

**The difference between `myFunctionCall(++foo)` and `myFunctionCall(foo++)` is in the order in which the increment operator and the function call are evaluated, and in the value that is passed to the function.**
