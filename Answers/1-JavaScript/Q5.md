# In your own words, explain what a javascript ‘class’ is and how it differs from a function

In JavaScript, a class is a 'template' for creating objects. It is a way to define a new type of object, with its own properties and methods.

Classes are defined using the `class` keyword, and they can have a constructor function (which is called when a new instance (an object) of the class is created), as well as properties and methods that are shared by all instances of the class.

I like call classes **'object Factorie'** because they manufacture objects, technically functions can do this too by returning an object

illustration of a class

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) { // logic for creating object
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() { // method
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
const person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

// functions too can acutally be called with "new"
// thats becasue class are syntatic sugars that makes OOP easier in javascript

person1.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."
person2.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old."

```

Classes are different from regular functions in a few key ways:

1. Syntax: Classes use a different syntax than regular functions, with the class keyword and a constructor function that is defined using the constructor keyword.

2. Instances: Classes are used to create instances of objects, using the new keyword. Each instance of a class is a separate object with its own properties and methods.

3. Inheritance: Classes can be used to create a hierarchy of objects, with one class inheriting from another. This allows to create a base class with common functionality, and then extend that class to create more specific subclasses.
