# How do you test in your unit tests to see if the correct properties are being passed to child components.

I would:

- Use the render function to render the parent component
- Mock the child component with jest.fn()
- define the expected props for the child component
- Use assertions to verify that the child component is being called with the props.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, getByTestId } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';


test('passes the correct props to ChildComponent', () => {
  const ChildComponent = jest.fn()
  const props = {
		foo: 'one',
		bar: 'two',
	};
  render(<MyComponent {...props} />);
  expect(ChildComponent).toHaveBeenCalledWith(props): // or whatever the expected props are for ChildComponent
});
```
