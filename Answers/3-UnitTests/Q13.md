# How do you test in your unit tests to see if the correct properties are being passed to child components.

I would

- Use the render function to render the component and its child components. This will return an object containing a number of utility functions that you can use to interact with and query the rendered components.

- Use the getByTestId functionto access the child components

- Use the getByTestId function or another utility function to access the properties

- Use assertions to verify that the child components are receiving the expected properties.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, getByTestId } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';


test('passes the correct props to ChildComponent', () => {
  const ChildComponent = jest.fn()
  render(<MyComponent />);
  expect(ChildComponent).toHaveBeenCalledWith(props)
});
```
