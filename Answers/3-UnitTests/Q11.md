# What technologies do you use to unit test your react components?

I use Jest, and now Vitest testing library (I started using Vite for newer projects for the better DX), and Jest does not work with vite out of the box (support for import/export and some other ecma features)
Vitest and Jest are basically identical in syntax

I super charge these with libraries including
Happydom for virtual Dom environment outside of a browser when i can mimick a browser dom to setup unit tests

React-testing-library for testing unit and integrated components
